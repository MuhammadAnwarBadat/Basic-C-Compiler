#Getting Started
This README file provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and use the compiler.

#Prerequisites
The following are the tools that are required to run the compiler, such as:

Bison (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r6dyIJFf486e7lmraXt4tw9s5ARWNoTe/view?usp=drive_web)
Flex (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qqgC7G4NFKhqV-OzBxSxaJ0D0XhHXfHS/view?usp=drive_web)
GNU/Yacc/MinGW (https://drive.google.com/file/d/13kUwWkxHGggRrkqdewAVq4U5q4MN3ek1/view?usp=drive_web)
Embarcadero Dev-C++ (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jQ6lmwC_5TGsUO01BG9ic5vhIVXqu7Mz/view?usp=drive_web)

#Installation
Download Flex, Bison, MinGW, and Embarcadero Dev-C++
How to setup and install MinGW (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWTocqPrzMk)

1. Download the project files from GitHub.
2. Extract the files into a folder of your choice.
3. Open a terminal in that folder.
4. Run the following commands to run Example1 and other programs respectively.

#Usage
Follow the below steps to run the project:

1. Open a terminal in the folder where the project files are located.
2. Type the following command to compile your C++ code: ./a.exe Example1.cpp
3. If there are no errors, the compiler will generate an executable file with the name Example1.exe.
4. Type the following command to run the executable file: ./Example1.exe.

#Features
Features of the compiler, such as:

Lexical analysis using Flex.
Parsing using Bison.
Semantic analysis to check for errors.
Code generation for x86 processors.
